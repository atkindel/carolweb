  <h3>Resources for researchers</h3>

  Stanford conveys digital learning opportunities on multiple online
  platforms, including Lagunita (an instance of the OpenEdX platform), Coursera,
  and NovoEd. Data collection infrastructure developed by CAROL converts
  platform exports into tabular formats that are amenable to analysis
  with common statistical software packages. More information on available
  data can be found at <a href="http://datastage.stanford.edu">Stanford Datastage</a>.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL makes data from Stanford's online courses available to Stanford investigators.
  CAROL is able to share limited data collected from Stanford's public courses on Lagunita
  after June 14, 2014 with investigators at other institutions for purposes of non-proprietary
  academic inquiry. Applications for data may be submitted at the
  <a href="http://vpol.stanford.edu/research">VPTL Data Portal</a>.
