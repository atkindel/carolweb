  <h3>About the Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning</h3>

  The ubiquity of instruction conveyed through digital media brings extraordinary
  opportunities for research across the human sciences. Data from digital learning environments
  have the potential to enable major advances in our understanding of human interaction while
  informing the design of richer instructional opportunities. The Center for Advanced
  Research through Online Learning (CAROL) provides support for these endeavors.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is a repository for the secure storage, curation and sharing of online learning data for purposes
  of scientific research. CAROL houses data derived from learning opportunities conveyed through
  several of Stanford's digital learning environments. Qualified researchers at Stanford and
  worldwide may apply for access to some of these data to pursue scientific inquiry.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is also a forum for the development of institutional, national and global policies for the ethical
  governance of research data produced in digital learning environments. CAROL works closely with faculty throughout Stanford
  and from other institutions to articulate protocols for the collection, use, and security of digital learning data.
  Our work is guided by the <a href='http://asilomar-highered.info'> Asilomar Convention for Learning Research in Higher Education</a>.
  <br/><br/>

  The work of CAROL is overseen by Stanford's intramural science governance system, which includes
  the VPTL Data Policy Working Group as well as Stanford University's offices of Research Compliance
  and General Counsel.
