  <h3>About the Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning</h3>

  The growing ubiquity of instruction conveyed through digital media brings extraordinary
  opportunities for research across the human sciences. Data from digital learning environments
  has the potential to enable major advances in modeling human learning and can inform
  the design of better educational opportunities both on- and offline.
  <br/><br/>

  The Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning (CAROL) provides support for
  these endeavors. CAROL manages data streams from instructional offerings on multiple
  digital platforms, curates these data for purposes of research, and maintains computational
  tools for their analysis by experts in a wide variety of fields.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is housed within the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences and supports
  investigators throughout Stanford University. CAROL also makes online learner data
  available on a limited basis to qualified investigators worldwide.
  <br/><br/>

  Stanford is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical integrity in
  research in online learning environments. As a forum for careful consideration of the
  ethics of digital learning research, CAROL contributes to Stanfordâ€™s intramural
  science governance system and to a growing national conversation on the ethics of digital research.
