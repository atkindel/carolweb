  <h3>Resources for researchers</h3>

  Stanford conveys digital learning opportunities on multiple online
  platforms, including Lagunita (an instance of the OpenEdX platform), Coursera,
  and NovoEd. Data collection infrastructure developed by CAROL converts
  platform exports into tabular formats that are amenable to analysis
  with many statistical software packages. More information on available
  data can be found <a href="http://datastage.stanford.edu">here</a>.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL makes data from Stanford's online courses available to qualified Stanford investigators.
  We also share limited data collected from Stanford's public courses conveyed on Lagunita
  after June 14, 2014 with qualified investigators at other institutions. Applications for data
  may be submitted at the <a href="http://vptl.stanford.edu/vptl-data-portal">here</a>.
