  <h3>Center for Advancing Research through Online Learning</h3>

  The growing ubiquity of instruction conveyed in digital environments represents
  a unique opportunity to advance the science of human learning. Since 2012, Stanford
  has been an international leader in the production of free, online courses for the
  general public. Research has been part of this enterprise since its inception, and
  the University has continued to invest in advancing learning science alongside its
  commitment to advancing teaching and learning broadly.<br/><br/>

  The Center for Advancing Research through Online Learning (CAROL) was created
  in 2015 to support ongoing research in digital learning environments and to seed
  inquiry across the social sciences broadly. In collaboration with the Office of
  the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning (VPTL), CAROL manages data streams from
  course offerings on three digital platforms: Coursera, NovoEd, and Lagunita,
  Stanford's instance of the OpenEdX platform. CAROL curates learner data from
  courses conveyed through these platforms, and offers resources to enable researchers
  without a data science background to conduct rigorous and theoretically-driven
  inquiries about the learning process.
  <br/><br/>

  As laboratories for the study of social behavior, online instructional
  environments present new challenges for the responsible governance of social science.
  In addition to supporting digital learning research through its data archive and
  computational services, CAROL is a forum for critical discourse about the ethics
  and politics of digital learning research.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is affiliated with the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences
  and supports research activity across the School of Humanities and Sciences,
  the Graduate School of Education, and the School of Engineering. As part of
  Stanford's intramural science governance system, CAROL collaborates with
  faculty and students, the Office of General Counsel, and the Dean of Research
  to ensure that scientific inquiry in digital learning environments is
  performed with careful consideration of the rights and privacy of learners.
