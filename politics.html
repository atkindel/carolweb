  <h3>The ethics and politics of educational data science</h3>

  Stanford has been an active driver of national conversations about
  ethical dimensions of academic research using online learning data.
  Our research activity is guided by the
  <a href='http://asilomar-highered.info'> Asilomar Convention for
  Learning Research in Higher Education</a>. Our intramural research
  and external data shares are overseen by a Data Policy Working Group,
  which works in concert with Stanfordâ€™s VPTL and Office of General
  Counsel.
