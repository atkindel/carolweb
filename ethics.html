  <h3>The ethics of research with digital learning data</h3>

  Stanford has been an active driver of national conversations about
  ethical dimensions of academic research using online learning data.
  Our work is guided by the <a href='http://asilomar-highered.info'> Asilomar
  Convention for Learning Research in Higher Education</a>. Stanford's intramural research
  and external data shares are overseen by a Data Policy Working Group, which works
  in concert with Stanford's Offices of Research Compliance and General Counsel.
