  <h3>Center for Advancing Research through Online Learning</h3>

  Since 2012, Stanford University has invested substantially in 

  The Center for Advancing Research through Online Learning (CAROL) supports
  and seeds research in digital learning environments across the social sciences.
  The growing ubiquity of instruction conveyed in digital environments represents
  a unique opportunity to advance the science of human learning.
  <br/><br/>

  To support digital learning research, CAROL maintains an archive of research
  datasets derived from Stanford's online instructional offerings. In
  collaboration with the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning
  (VPTL), CAROL manages data streams from course offerings on three digital
  platforms: Coursera, NovoEd, and Lagunita, Stanford's instance of the
  open-source EdX platform.
  <br/><br/>

  In addition to supporting digital learning research, CAROL is a forum for
  critical discourse about the ethics and politics of digital learning
  research
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is affiliated with the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences
  and supports research activity across the School of Humanities and Sciences,
  the Graduate School of Education, and the School of Engineering.

  As part of Stanford's intramural science governance system, CAROL collaborates
  with faculty, the Office of General Counsel, and the Research Compliance Office
  to ensure that scientific inquiry in digital learning environments is performed
  with careful consideration of the rights and privacy of learners.
