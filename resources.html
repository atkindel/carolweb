  <h3>Resources for researchers</h3>

  Stanford conveys its digital learning offerings on three online
  platforms: Lagunita (an instance of the OpenEdX platform), Coursera,
  and NovoEd. Data collection infrastructure developed at CAROL converts
  platform exports into tabular formats that are amenable to analysis
  with common statistical software packages. In addition, CAROL works
  to produce high quality aggregate datasets for benchmarking purposes.
  More information on available data can be found at
  <a href="http://datastage.stanford.edu">Stanford Datastage</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  In addition to making digital learning data from all three platforms
  available to Stanford researchers, CAROL is able to share Lagunita
  data collected after June 14, 2014 with researchers at other
  institutions. We consider requests for data shares from researchers
  beyond Stanford solely for purposes of non-proprietary academic
  inquiry. Applications may be submitted at the
  <a href="http://vpol.stanford.edu/research">VPTL Data Portal</a>.
