Mission
The Stanford Center for Population Research supports, encourages and facilitates research and training in population studies. It endeavors to bring a diverse group of scientists together for studying the complex processes connected with the size, distribution, and composition of human populations.  The Center's core research themes are:

 Formal Demography
 Biodemography, including genetics and life histories
 Economic Demography
 Human Evolution
 Cultural and Intergenerational Processes
 Mortality and International Health

The Center offers seed grants to Stanford faculty for demographic research; initiates and supports collaborations among Stanford researchers in the social and biological sciences that will advance demographic research; sponsors colloquia, conferences, workshops, research networks, and special data collections; and fosters links and collaborations in population studies between researchers at Stanford and at population centers around the U.S. and internationally. The Center is an affiliate of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.





The Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society (Stanford PACS) develops and shares knowledge to improve philanthropy, strengthen civil society and effect social change.  Stanford PACS connects students, scholars and practitioners and publishes the preeminent journal Stanford Social Innovation Review (SSIR).

Stanford PACS is a research center for students, scholars and practitioners to explore and share ideas that create social change.  Its primary participants are Stanford faculty, visiting scholars, postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students, and nonprofit and foundation practitioners.

As publisher of Stanford Social Innovation Review,  Stanford PACS informs policy and social innovation, philanthropic investment and nonprofit practice.  SSIR is shared intellectual space where scholars and practitioners publish interdisciplinary and cross-sector research and ideas to advance social change.

Stanford PACS has relationships with five Schools (Humanities & Sciences, Engineering, Education, Business, and Law) and twenty departments, and we leverage the intellectual assets of a diverse, world-class faculty across the University.  This provides a unique platform to share our work with the nonprofit and for-profit community in Silicon Valley and globally.

Stanford PACS offers post-doctoral fellows, PhD fellowships, and financial support for undergraduates completing honors thesis work. Additionally, Stanford PACS sponsors a monthly public speaker series and other symposia and salons that include speakers who are well known academic, foundation or nonprofit leaders.
