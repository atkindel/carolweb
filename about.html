  <h3>About the Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning</h3>

  The growing ubiquity of instruction conveyed through digital media brings extraordinary
  opportunities for research across the human sciences. Data from digital learning environments
  has the potential to enable major advances in modeling human learning and can inform
  the design of better educational opportunities both on- and offline. The Center for Advanced
  Research through Online Learning (CAROL), housed within the Institute for Research in the
  Social Sciences, provides support for these endeavors.
  <br/><br/>

  CAROL is a repository for the secure storage, curation and sharing of online learning data for purposes
  of scientific research. CAROL houses data derived from learning opportunities conveyed through
  Stanford’s wide range of digital learning environments. Qualified researchers at Stanford and
  worldwide may apply for access to some of these data to pursue scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>

  CAROL is a forum for the development of national and global policies for the ethical
  and transparent governance of scientific inquiry in online learning environments.
  CAROL works closely with faculty throughout Stanford and from other institutions to articulate
  protocols for data collection, security, and use. Through open and iterative deliberation CAROL
  develops standards for scientific practice appropriate for the digital era. Our work is guided by the
  <a href='http://asilomar-highered.info'> Asilomar Convention for Learning Research in Higher Education</a>.<br/><br/>

  <h3>The ethics of research with digital learning data</h3>

  CAROL contributes to Stanford’s intramural science governance system as a forum for
  careful consideration of the ethics of digital learning research. Stanford University is
  committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical integrity in
  research in online learning environments. Our research efforts and external data shares
  are overseen by a Data Policy Working Group, which works in concert with Stanford's
  Offices of Research Compliance and General Counsel as well as the Office of the Vice
  Provost for Teaching and Learning.
