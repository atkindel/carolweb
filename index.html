  <h3>Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning</h3>

  The Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning (CAROL) cultivates
  an interdisciplinary research community at Stanford focused on the unique
  affordances of online learning for research across the social sciences.
  The mission of CAROL is to steward data from online learning interactions and to develop
  standards for the ethical governance of research in digital learning environments.<br/><br/>

  CAROL is a repository for the secure storage and sharing of online learning data for purposes
  of scientific research. CAROL houses data collected through Stanfordâ€™s online learning opportunities.
  Qualified researchers at Stanford and worldwide may apply for access to some of
  these data to pursue scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>

  CAROL is a forum for the development of national and global policies for the ethical
  and transparent governance of scientific inquiry in online learning environments.
  CAROL works closely with faculty throughout Stanford and from other institutions to articulate
  protocols for data collection, security, and use. Through open and iterative deliberation CAROL
  develops standards for scientific practice appropriate for the digital era.<br/><br/>
